# Digital-Display-Board
A simple and impactful digital display board designed for low-resource communities like Dharavi, Asia's largest slum. Displays real-time announcements, water timings, weather updates, and government schemes with audio support in their regional language

ðŸ§© Problem Statement:

Dharavi, Asiaâ€™s largest slum, is home to thousands of families living in extremely cramped conditions with limited access to basic services.
Most people here donâ€™t have smartphones or internet, and many are not comfortable reading long text notices.
Because of this, important updates like water supply timings, ration distribution, job melas, and health camps often donâ€™t reach the people on time.
Right now, information is usually spread by word-of-mouth, handwritten notes, or not announced at all, leading to confusion, missed opportunities, and daily struggles.

ðŸ’¡ Solution:

We created a Digital Display Board just for communities like Dharavi.
It shows important government schemes, local programs, and alerts â€” all in a way thatâ€™s easy for everyone to understand.

âœ… What it does:

ðŸ“¢ Shows rotating slides with images and short text

ðŸ•’ Displays live time and weather info

ðŸ”Š Speaks out water supply timings in their regional language, 30 mins before

ðŸ§’ Shows info on mid-day meals, health camps, and job fairs, ration scheme , educational benifits

Itâ€™s simple, visual, and made to bridge the communication gap for people who donâ€™t have access to phones or apps.
